              You gain a specialist. The specialist is part of your crew, but is tracked as a connection and provides benefits to you and your allies per their role. When you [Withstand Damage](datasworn:move:starforged/suffer/withstand_damage) and score a miss, or if you [Pay the Price](datasworn:move:starforged/fate/pay_the_price), you may suffer the cost by noting the specialist as out of action. An out of action specialist provides no benefit. To restore a specialist to duty, resolve the situation as appropriate to the nature of the injury, trauma, or dispute.
