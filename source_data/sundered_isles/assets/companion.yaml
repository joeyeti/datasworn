            This animate skull does not use a health meter, but is as vulnerable to destruction or loss as any object. When you make a move in its presence, add a cursed die (ten-sided) to the roll. If that die rolls a 10, you glean insight from the skull’s incessant chatter as follows.

              * If you rolled a miss, reroll all dice. If you miss again, the skull leads you astray.
