&#x2610; Once per fight, when you Gain Ground through intimidation or command, reroll any dice and mark progress on a hit. 

### Oathbreaker

Once you Forsake Your Vow…

&#x2612; This asset counts as an impact. One time only, when you Swear an Iron Vow (extreme or greater) to redeem yourself, give that vow a special mark. When you Reach a Milestone on the marked vow, take +2 momentum. If you Forsake Your Vow on the quest, discard this asset and retain the impact.

&#x2610; When you Secure an Advantage or Compel by reaffirming your commitment to your marked vow, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.

&#x2610; When you Fulfill Your Vow on the marked quest and score a hit, you find redemption and automatically gain this ability at no cost. You may then improve one of your stats by +1 and discard this asset. Once the asset is discarded, you may not take it again. 

### Revenant

Once you Face Death…

&#x2612; When you are at 0 health, and Endure Harm or Face Death, add +1. You may then reroll your action die if its value is less than your spirit.

&#x2610; When you Take Decisive Action by bringing death to a foe, you may burn momentum to zero out one (not both) of the challenge dice if your momentum is greater than the value of that die. If you do, Endure Stress (-2).

&#x2610; When you Gather Information by studying a place where death left its mark, you may roll +heart. If you do, take +1 momentum on a hit. On a strong hit with a match, you experience a detailed vision or insightful revelation of what occurred here; take +1 momentum more.

Once you mark traumatized or permanently harmed…

&#x2612; When you are haunted by past experiences and must Endure Stress, you may Lose Momentum (-1) before rolling as you attempt to find focus or calm. If you do, reroll any dice. On a strong hit, take +1 momentum.

&#x2610; When you make a move where a lasting effect (traumatized or permanently harmed) has a narrative impact on the scene or your approach, and burn momentum to improve your result, you may envision what sustains or motivates you in this moment. If you do, mark 1 tick on your quests or bonds legacy track. On a strong hit with a match, mark 2 ticks.

&#x2610; You are learning to live with this impact. The lasting effect (traumatized or permanently harmed, but not both) remains marked, but no longer reduces your max momentum or reset. 

### Vanguard

Once you fill 6 boxes on your discoveries legacy track...

&#x2612; When you seek a safe location in a remote environment, make a progress roll against your discoveries legacy track. On a strong hit, you establish a haven; add +2 whenever you make a recovery move at that location. On a weak hit, as above, but add +1 when making a recovery move. On a miss, you are drawn into a bad situation and must Pay the Price. If you establish a haven but score a miss on a recovery move, that location is no longer safe.

&#x2610; When you make a move +wits and score a strong hit with a match, your hard-won experience lends insight; take +1 momentum.

&#x2610; When you Endure Stress, you may roll +wits. If you do, take +1 momentum on a hit.
